start: domain/url
- logs every request/response through a proxy and a selenium/chrome instance
- starting url and its relative subsequent requests are identified by uuid
- every request will also be identified by a uuid/hash (chrome already does this)
- everything is timestamped (chrome already does this)
- everything is hashed + simhashed (todo: simhash)
- tls certificates are logged (mitmproxy interferes wit this, todo: find a way to get the original certificate info)



Nice-to-have:
- find a way to automagically find common substrings in a list of elements which are not present in any other element (IOCs)
- periodically check DNS resolution with from multiple countries.
- periodically re-analyze URLs to check whether they're still up  
- Save ASN info (geoip as well?)
